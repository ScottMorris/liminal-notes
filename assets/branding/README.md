# Liminal Notes icon source

- **Master file:** `liminal-notes-icon.png` (AI-generated PNG, 793x796).
- **Usage:** Run `pnpm generate:icons` from the repo root to upscale to 1024x1024 (Lanczos3, transparent padding) and regenerate all desktop and mobile app icons.
- **Where it is used:** Desktop/Tauri icons (`apps/desktop/src-tauri/icons/`) and mobile/Expo assets (`apps/mobile/assets/`) are produced from this source via the script above.
- If you replace the master, drop the new PNG here (keep a high-resolution version) and rerun the script to refresh all variants.
